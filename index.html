             <p>I haven`t worked for IT companies before, but around a year I`m deeply interested and involved in studying. My goal is to become a developer and I`m willing to work hard for it. I`m patient, mature and able to work under pressure and short deadlines. Also Iâ€™m careful to details and at the moment I spend all my time for studying. I enjoy studying the course by RSSchool. It's a very interesting project that allows me to learn new things and discover my strengths.</p>
             <p>I`m interested in the position of Junior Front-end, but also I would like to learn Back-end. </p>
             <p>My relevant skills are: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, Webpack, TypeScript.</p>
             <p>I studied economy and management at BSEU. </p>
             <p>Additionally, I was self-studying by watching YouTube webinars about web design and HTML coding.</p>
             <p>My English level is around A2. At the moment I`m having classes with a tutor to improve my language skills. </p>
             <p>I`m dedicated to the profession and see myself working long-term with a company. I`m sure that my enthusiasm, dedication and initiative will be very helpful to EPAM.</p>
